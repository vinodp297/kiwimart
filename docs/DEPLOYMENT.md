### Build Settings

| Setting          | Value             |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Framework Preset | Next.js           |
| Build Command    | `npm run build`   |
| Install Command  | `npm install`     |
| Output Directory | `.next` (default) |
| Node.js Version  | 18.x or 20.x      |
| Region           | `sfo1`            |

### Cron Job Configuration

Defined in `vercel.json`. Vercel automatically invokes these endpoints on schedule, passing `CRON_SECRET` as the Bearer token.

| Path                              | Schedule                   | Description                                     |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/cron/auto-release`          | `0 2 * * *` (2 AM UTC)     | Capture escrow for overdue deliveries           |
| `/api/cron/dispute-auto-resolve`  | `0 3 * * *` (3 AM UTC)     | Auto-resolve unresponsive disputes              |
| `/api/cron/expire-listings`       | `30 3 * * *` (3:30 AM UTC) | Expire old listings, release offer reservations |
| `/api/cron/delivery-reminders`    | `0 4 * * *` (4 AM UTC)     | Reminder emails + auto-complete overdue orders  |
| `/api/cron/seller-downgrade`      | `0 6 * * *` (6 AM UTC)     | Downgrade seller tiers on poor metrics          |
| `/api/cron/daily-digest`          | `0 7 * * *` (7 AM UTC)     | Admin summary email                             |
| `/api/cron/stripe-reconciliation` | `0 14 * * *` (2 PM UTC)    | Log payment/order state mismatches              |

### Domain Configuration

1. Add your custom domain in Vercel project settings.
2. Configure DNS: CNAME record pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`.
3. Vercel automatically provisions SSL.
4. Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to match the production domain.

## Database (Neon PostgreSQL)

### Connection String Format

```
# Pooled (for application — via Prisma Accelerate)
DATABASE_URL="prisma://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=..."

# Direct (for migrations only)
DATABASE_DIRECT_URL="postgresql://user:pass@ep-xxx.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/kiwimart?sslmode=require"
```

### Running Migrations

```bash
# On deploy (production — applies pending migrations)
npx prisma migrate deploy

# During development (creates new migration)
npx prisma migrate dev --name descriptive_name
```

### Seeding

```bash
# Development seed (sample data)
npx prisma db seed

# Production seed (categories, regions, config)
npx tsx prisma/seed-production.ts
```

### Backup Procedure

1. Neon provides automatic daily backups with point-in-time restore (paid plans).
2. For manual backups: `pg_dump` via the direct connection URL.
3. Neon branching can be used to create instant database copies for staging/testing.

### Branching for Staging

```bash
# Create a branch from production for testing
neon branches create --name staging --parent main
```

Each Neon branch gets its own connection string. Set this as `DATABASE_DIRECT_URL` in your staging environment.

## BullMQ Workers (Railway)

### What the Worker Process Does

The worker (`src/worker.ts`) starts four BullMQ workers in a single Node.js process:

1. **Email Worker** — Sends transactional emails via Resend (welcome, offers, dispatch, disputes)
2. **Image Worker** — Downloads images from R2, scans, resizes to 1200px + 480px thumbnail, converts to WebP, strips EXIF/GPS, re-uploads
3. **Payout Worker** — Initiates Stripe Connect transfers to sellers after order completion
4. **Pickup Worker** — Manages pickup lifecycle timeouts (scheduling deadlines, no-show handling, OTP expiry)

### How to Deploy to Railway

1. Create a new Railway project and connect your GitHub repository.
2. Set the start command: `npx tsx src/worker.ts`
3. Set the required environment variables (see below).
4. Deploy. Railway will run the process continuously with automatic restarts.

### Required Environment Variables

The worker needs a subset of the app's environment variables:

| Variable                    | Purpose                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`              | Same as the web app (Prisma Accelerate or direct)                               |
| `REDIS_URL`                 | TCP Redis connection for BullMQ (e.g., `redis://...` or `rediss://...` for TLS) |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`         | For payout transfers                                                            |
| `RESEND_API_KEY`            | For sending emails                                                              |
| `EMAIL_FROM`                | Sender address                                                                  |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`     | For R2 image operations                                                         |
| `R2_BUCKET_NAME`            | R2 bucket                                                                       |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`          | R2 credentials                                                                  |
| `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`      | R2 credentials                                                                  |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_PUBLIC_URL` | Public image URL base                                                           |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`       | For email links                                                                 |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY`            | For decrypting phone numbers (pickup worker)                                    |

### Health Monitoring

- The worker process logs structured JSON to stdout. Railway captures these automatically.
- Check for `worker.process.ready` log on startup.
- Check for `worker.error` logs for failures.
- BullMQ dashboard (Bull Board) can be added as a separate service if needed.
- Failed jobs are retained in Redis and can be inspected: `npm run workers:check`

## Cloudflare R2

### Bucket Setup

1. Create a bucket in Cloudflare R2 (e.g., `buyzi-images`).
2. Generate an API token with read/write access to the bucket.
3. Note the account ID, access key ID, and secret access key.

### CORS Configuration

R2 requires CORS for direct browser uploads via presigned URLs. Configure in the Cloudflare dashboard:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["https://buyzi.co.nz", "http://localhost:3000"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["Content-Type", "Content-Length"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

### Public Access Settings

- Enable public access on the R2 bucket or use a Cloudflare Worker/custom domain for the public URL.
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_PUBLIC_URL` to the public access URL (e.g., `https://images.buyzi.co.nz`).
- The image proxy at `/api/images/[...key]` can serve images with caching headers as an alternative to direct R2 public access.

## Monitoring

### Sentry

- **What it monitors:** Uncaught exceptions, unhandled promise rejections, API errors (5xx), and slow transactions.
- **How to access:** Log in at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), select the KiwiMart project.
- **Configuration:** Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` in environment variables. The structured logger forwards `.error()` and `.fatal()` calls to Sentry automatically.
- **Alerts:** Configure alert rules in Sentry for error rate spikes and new issue notifications.

### PostHog

- **What it tracks:** Page views, user sign-ups, listing creations, purchases, search queries, and custom events.
- **How to access:** Log in at your PostHog instance (`NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`).
- **Configuration:** Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`.

### Vercel Analytics

- **What to watch:** Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS), function execution duration, cold start times.
- **How to access:** Vercel project dashboard → Analytics tab.
- **Built in:** `@vercel/analytics` and `@vercel/speed-insights` packages are already integrated.

### Health Endpoints

| Endpoint              | Purpose                                 | Auth                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `/api/ping`           | Basic liveness check                    | None                         |
| `/api/health`         | Application health (DB connectivity)    | None                         |
| `/api/admin/health`   | Detailed health (DB, Redis, Stripe, R2) | Admin auth                   |
| `/api/workers/health` | Worker process health                   | `WORKER_SECRET` Bearer token |

## Incident Response

### High Error Rate

1. Check Sentry for the error spike — identify the affected endpoint or service.
2. Hit `/api/health` to verify the application is responsive.
3. Check Vercel function logs for timeout errors or cold start issues.
4. If database-related: check Neon dashboard for connection limits or slow queries.
5. If Redis-related: check Upstash dashboard for rate limit hits or connectivity issues.

### Payment Failures

1. Check Stripe dashboard (Payments → filter by failed) for the specific error.
2. Check `/api/webhooks/stripe` logs in Vercel for webhook delivery failures.
3. Verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches the current Stripe endpoint configuration.
4. Check `stripe-reconciliation` cron output for logged mismatches.
5. For stuck `PAYMENT_HELD` orders: verify the PaymentIntent status in Stripe matches the DB.

### Database Slowness

1. Check Neon dashboard for active connections (should be well under the limit with Prisma Accelerate pooling).
2. Check Prisma Accelerate dashboard for query latency percentiles.
3. Look for N+1 query patterns in recent deployments.
4. Check if any long-running transactions are holding locks.
5. Consider creating a Neon branch to test query performance in isolation.

### Worker Failures

1. Check Railway logs for error output from `src/worker.ts`.
2. Run `npm run workers:check` to inspect failed jobs in BullMQ queues.
3. Check Redis connectivity — if Redis is down, all workers stall.
4. Verify the `REDIS_URL` is correct and the Redis instance has available memory.
5. Check individual queue depth — a large backlog in the `image` queue may indicate R2 connectivity issues; in the `payout` queue may indicate Stripe API issues.

### Real-Time Messaging Down

1. Check Pusher dashboard for connection counts and error rates.
2. Verify `PUSHER_KEY`, `PUSHER_SECRET`, and `PUSHER_CLUSTER` environment variables.
3. Check `/api/pusher/auth` endpoint for authentication errors.
4. Note: messaging falls back gracefully — messages are persisted in the database regardless of Pusher status. Users will see messages on page refresh even if WebSocket delivery fails.

### Bot/Spam Attack

1. Check Upstash dashboard for rate limit hit rates — spikes indicate an attack.
2. Verify Cloudflare Turnstile is active (`NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` and `CLOUDFLARE_TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` are set).
3. Check for bulk account creation in the admin panel.
4. Consider temporarily tightening rate limits in `src/server/lib/rateLimit.ts`.
